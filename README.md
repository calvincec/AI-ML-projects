# AI-ML-projects
python notebook projects mostly covering AI and ML codes
These projects are mainly used to help in understanding some concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning taught during my second year classes
The knowledge was gained from Computer Science(IV) unit taught in Electrical and Electronics engineering at the University of Nairobi 
Description about the objective of each file is stated from the notebook itself using the text cells

<h2>Components</h2>
<h4>1. Tick tack toe game</h4>
This notebook helps in understanding the Adversarial search Algorithm used in Artificial Intelligence <br/> 
It aims to code the famous Tic Tac Toe game which involves two players with consercutive moves one player uses X as his/her move and the other uses O <br/> 
In this case, a user is going to play against the AI model <br/> 

<h2>How to use them</h2>

. Download each file to your local machine, or clone them to the local repository <br/> 
. Save each file to your google drive account and run using google colaboratory app <br/> 
. You may prefer using any other notebook but remember to ensure your local machine has the required libraries installed <br/> 
. The required libraries are in the first code cells of each file
