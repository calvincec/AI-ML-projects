# AI-ML-projects
python notebook projects mostly covering AI and ML codes
These projects are mainly used to help in understanding some concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning taught during my second year classes
The knowledge was gained from Computer Science(IV) unit taught in Electrical and Electronics engineering at the University of Nairobi 
Description about the objective of each file is stated from the notebook itself using the text cells

<h2>Components</h2>
<h4>1. Tick tack toe game</h4>
This notebook helps in understanding the Adversarial search Algorithm used in Artificial Intelligence <br/> 
It aims to code the famous Tic Tac Toe game which involves two players with consercutive moves one player uses X as his/her move and the other uses O <br/> 
In this case, a user is going to play against the AI model <br/> 
<h4>2. Knights and knaves</h4>
This project Used to enhance understanding of the knowledge and Reasoning concepts to solve logic puzzles<br/>
The idea is based on Raymond Smullyan's book, "What is the name of this book?" which contains “Knights and Knaves” puzzles.<br/>
More description about the code is well illustrated in the notebook itself

<h4>3. Traffic Light model</h4>
This work aims to explore Machine Learning algorithms. <br/>
It focuses on using Neural Networks and activation functions and their application in training, testing and evaluation of models<br/>
This project uses TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs<br/>
It uses the the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset which is a labbeled data set  which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.<br/>
German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset can be found in the following link:

You may clone this to the local repository to see how it works


<h2>How to use them</h2>

. Download each file to your local machine, or clone them to the local repository <br/> 
. Save each file to your google drive account and run using google colaboratory app <br/> 
. You may prefer using any other notebook but remember to ensure your local machine has the required libraries installed <br/> 
. The required libraries are in the first code cells of each file <br/> 
. You may prefer using the `preview` button on each code to see its layout and general implementation
